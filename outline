classes:
  Main
  Friend(float fire_rate, float damage, int damage_radius, projectiles[], int hit_type, string image_path, int tier, ...)
  Enemy(float speed, float health, float damage, string image_path, int tier, int reward, ...)
  Node(int x, int y, int dx, int dy) # for enemy pathfinding
  Projectile(int x, int y, int dx, int dy) # gets the damage and speed from parent Friend(), this is for single target projectiles
  Splash_Projectile(int x, int y, int dx, int dy) # gets damage, speed, radius from parent Friend(), this is for Area of Effect projectiles
  # note that we could either combine Projectile() and Splash_Projectile() into one class or keep them separate
